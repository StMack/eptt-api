<h3 class="text-center">TERMS AND CONDITIONS</h3>
<p>
This AT&T API  Joint Marketing Agreement ("Agreement") is between AT&T Mobility LLC ("AT&T") and (“You” or “Developer”) governing Your use of the Service, including all application programming interfaces ("API(s)"), information, content, products, materials, and services made available to You by AT&T or third parties related to the Enhanced Push-to-Talk (“EPTT”) Service (the "Service"). "You" and "Your" means and refers to the person(s) or legal entity using the Service or otherwise exercising rights under this Agreement. If You are entering into this Agreement on behalf of Your company, "You" or "Your" refers to your company as well.
Please read this Agreement carefully prior to using the Service. By using or otherwise accessing the Service, You (a) acknowledge that you have read this Agreement and agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement on behalf of yourself (if an individual) or the legal entity that you represent (in the case of a legal entity), and (b) warrant that you have authority to execute this Agreement and bind the person or entity. If You do not agree to the terms of this Agreement, do not use the Service.

			<li>AT&T may also recommend to its customers that they purchase Your Products.</li>

			<li>Nothing herein prohibits AT&T from marketing products not manufactured by You which serve essentially the same function.  Nothing herein prevents You from marketing and selling Your Products or similar products serving essentially the same function to other providers of services similar to the Service.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>

Further, to the extent You obtain or use CPNI in connection with this Agreement, You will be an agent of AT&T with respect to the receipt and use of such information.  “CPNI” means Customer Proprietary Network Information as defined by the Federal Communications Act of 1934, as amended and the Federal Communications Commission rules promulgated thereunder (Federal and State CPNI laws and regulations are referred to herein as the “CPNI Restrictions”).  You agree to receive and use CPNI consistent with the CPNI Restrictions and in the manner specified herein with respect to AT&T Information received under this Agreement as set forth in Section 3 (Confidentiality) below.
