						<p>
This AT&T API  Joint Marketing Agreement ("Agreement") is between AT&T Mobility LLC ("AT&T") and (“You” or “Developer”) governing Your use of the Service, including all application programming interfaces ("API(s)"), information, content, products, materials, and services made available to You by AT&T or third parties related to the Enhanced Push-to-Talk (“EPTT”) Service (the "Service"). "You" and "Your" means and refers to the person(s) or legal entity using the Service or otherwise exercising rights under this Agreement. If You are entering into this Agreement on behalf of Your company, "You" or "Your" refers to your company as well.
Please read this Agreement carefully prior to using the Service. By using or otherwise accessing the Service, You (a) acknowledge that you have read this Agreement and agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement on behalf of yourself (if an individual) or the legal entity that you represent (in the case of a legal entity), and (b) warrant that you have authority to execute this Agreement and bind the person or entity. If You do not agree to the terms of this Agreement, do not use the Service.
The primary purpose of this Agreement is set forth the terms and conditions pursuant to which You will provide  software applications that access and use the Service’s application programming interfaces (“APIs”) (“Applications”) and related services (collectively “Your Products”)to our mutual customers.</p>

<ol class="jmaTerms">

	<li>SCOPE
		<ol>
			<li>This Agreement provides AT&T a non-exclusive right to market Your Products in all markets worldwide.  For purposes of this Agreement, “market” means to make customers and potential customers aware of the available service and integrated features and how to obtain them.</li>

			<li>AT&T may also recommend to its customers that they purchase Your Products.</li>

			<li>Nothing herein prohibits AT&T from marketing products not manufactured by You which serve essentially the same function.  Nothing herein prevents You from marketing and selling Your Products or similar products serving essentially the same function to other providers of services similar to the Service.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>

	<li>RELATIONSHIP OF THE PARTIES
		<ol>
			<li>General.   You agree to make reasonable commercial efforts to engage in joint sales presentations with AT&T sales representatives if requested by AT&T.</li>

			<li>You will join with AT&T in a set of focused sales activities to qualify opportunities around specific target vertical market segments (“Verticals”) and / or accounts to promote the AT&T value proposition.  The effort will include sharing target account names, establishing a cadence process surrounding opportunity engagement status as well as jointly developing the sales strategy for each customer / Vertical.</li>


			<li>Nature of Relationship.  The relationship created by this Agreement is that of independent contracting parties and is not any other relationship, including, without limitation, that of joint employers, a joint venture, or a partnership.  Personnel employed by, or acting under the authority of a party to this Agreement are not employees or agents of the other party.  AT&T and You each assume sole responsibility for the employment, compensation, discharge, and control of its own respective employees, contractors, and agents, and for ensuring their compliance with this Agreement.  You are not a general agent of AT&T.  Neither You nor any affiliate may be a reseller of AT&T’s Service, under this agreement.  Further, to the extent You obtain or use CPNI in connection with this Agreement, You will be an agent of AT&T with respect to the receipt and use of such information.  “CPNI” means Customer Proprietary Network Information as defined by the Federal Communications Act of 1934, as amended and the Federal Communications Commission rules promulgated thereunder (Federal and State CPNI laws and regulations are referred to herein as the “CPNI Restrictions”).  You agree to receive and use CPNI consistent with the CPNI Restrictions and in the manner specified herein with respect to AT&T Information received under this Agreement as set forth in Section 3 (Confidentiality) below.  These requirements include, but are not limited to, the following:  You agree that You will (1) not use any CPNI to market or otherwise sell products, except to the extent necessary to perform services for AT&T under this Agreement; (2) make no sale, license or lease of CPNI to any other party; (3) restrict access to CPNI to only those of Your employees that require access to perform services under this Agreement; and (4) promptly return all CPNI to AT&T upon expiration or termination of this Agreement, unless expressly agreed or instructed otherwise by AT&T.</li>

			<li>Commitments to Third Parties.  The parties have no authority to make any commitment on behalf of the other to any third party without written permission.</li>

			<li>Acknowledgements and Representations.
				<ol>
					<li>AT&T and You understand and accept that the terms, conditions, and covenants contained in this Agreement are reasonably necessary to maintain AT&T’s high standard for service and to protect and preserve the goodwill of the  Service and the AT&T brand.</li>

					<li>AT&T expressly disclaims the making of, and You acknowledge, that You and Your affiliates have not received, have no knowledge of, and are not relying on any representations by any employee or representative of AT&T or its affiliates as to: (i) the quality of the network from which AT&T services are provided; and (ii) any other factor relating to AT&T’s business operations, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement.  You represent that You have independently investigated the risk and opportunities of the business outlined in this Agreement and have independently decided to accept the terms of this Agreement.</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
		</ol>
	</li>


	<li>Confidentiality.
		<ol>
	
			<li>AT&T Information. You agree that information AT&T discloses to You under this Agreement, including but not limited to, ideas, concepts, know-how, techniques, designs, specifications, drawings, blueprints, tracings, diagrams, models, samples, flow charts, data, computer programs, disks, diskettes, tapes, marketing plans, and other technical, financial, customer or business information (individually and collectively, "Information") shall be deemed to be confidential and proprietary to AT&T. You agree to hold such Information in confidence with the same degree of care with which You protect Your own confidential or proprietary information, but no less than reasonably prudent care; use the AT&T Information only for the purpose of this Agreement; not copy, distribute, or otherwise use such Information or knowingly allow anyone else to copy, distribute, or otherwise use such Information, and any and all copies shall bear the same notices or legends, if any, as the originals; and upon request, promptly return to AT&T all AT&T Information that is in tangible form. As to AT&T Information that was disclosed in or is stored in intangible form, including, but not limited to electronic mail or other electronic communication, upon request by AT&T, You shall certify in writing within five (5) business days to AT&T that all such AT&T Information has been destroyed or, if the AT&T Information was recorded on an erasable storage medium, that You have used reasonable efforts to erase all such intangible Information.</li>
		
		
			<li>No Developer Disclosures by You. You agree that You do not intend to and that You will not disclose to AT&T  any information that You regard as proprietary regarding any of Your Products (“Developer Disclosures”). You warrant that all Developer Disclosures from You to AT&T  are or will be free of any obligation of confidence. AT&T works with many application and software developers and some of their products may be similar to or compete with Your Applications. AT&T may also be developing its own similar or competing applications and products or may decide to do so in the future. To avoid potential misunderstandings, AT&T cannot agree, and expressly disclaims, any confidentiality obligations or use restrictions, express or implied, with respect to any Developer Disclosures that You may provide in connection with this Agreement, including information about Your Application(s) and metadata. You agree that any Developer Disclosures You make to AT&T will be non-confidential. AT&T will be free to use and disclose any Developer Disclosures on an unrestricted basis without notifying or compensating You. You release AT&T from all liability and obligations that may arise from the receipt, review, use, or disclosure of any portion of any Developer Disclosures. Any physical materials You submit to AT&T that contain Developer Disclosures will become AT&T property and AT&T will have no obligation to return those materials to You or to certify their destruction.<br><br>
				
			Nothing in this Agreement will impair AT&T's right to develop, acquire, license, market, promote, or distribute products or technologies that perform the same or similar functions as, or otherwise compete with, Your Applications or any other products or technologies that You may develop, produce, market, or distribute.</li>

			<li>Your Other Confidential Information.  Information You disclose to AT&T concerning Your business plans, pricing and customers and any non-Developer Disclosures that are marked in writing as proprietary or confidential will be deemed to be Your Confidential Information and proprietary to You. AT&T agrees to hold Your Confidential Information in confidence with the same degree of care with which AT&T protects its own confidential or proprietary information, but no less than reasonably prudent care; use Your Confidential Information only for the purpose of this Agreement; not copy, distribute, or otherwise use Your Confidential Information or knowingly allow anyone else to copy, distribute, or otherwise use Your Confidential Information, and any and all copies shall bear the same notices or legends, if any, as the originals; and upon request, promptly return to You all Your Confidential Information that is in tangible form.  As to Your Confidential Information that was disclosed in or is stored in intangible form, including, but not limited to electronic mail or other electronic communication, upon request by You, AT&T shall certify in writing within thirty (30) business days to You that all such information has been destroyed or, if such information was recorded on an erasable storage medium, that AT&T has used reasonable efforts to erase all such intangible Information.</li>
